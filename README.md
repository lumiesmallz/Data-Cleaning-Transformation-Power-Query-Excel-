## Project Overview

Raw datasets often contain errors, duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formatting, and structural issues.
In this project, I applied industry-standard data cleaning techniques to:

Remove duplicates and invalid records

Fix structural errors and inconsistent formats

Handle missing or null values

Standardize data types (dates, numbers, text)

Normalize categorical fields

Create reusable transformation steps using Power Query

Build a clean, structured data model ready for reporting

## Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel

Power Query

Data Types & Formatting

Conditional Columns

M Language (Power Query)

Data Modelling Concepts

## Key Data Cleaning Tasks Performed
✔ 1. Removed Duplicates & Inconsistent Records

Identified and removed duplicate entries using conditional rules to ensure data integrity.

✔ 2. Corrected Formatting Issues

Standardised date formats

Trimmed whitespace

Fixed text inconsistencies (e.g., upper/lower case mismatches)

✔ 3. Handled Missing & Null Values

Replaced empty cells with appropriate default values

Removed rows that did not meet business logic thresholds

✔ 4. Transformed Raw Data Using Power Query

Applied step-by-step transformations

Automated cleaning logic with a refreshable Power Query pipeline

Ensured all steps can be reused for future dataset updates

✔ 5. Built a Reusable Data Model

Created a structured model suitable for use in Excel PivotTables, Power BI dashboards, or further analysis.

## Outcome

The cleaned dataset is now:

Fully reliable

Consistent

Validated

Refreshable (via Power Query)

Ready for reporting and visualization

This project demonstrates my ability to turn messy raw data into an analysis-ready dataset that supports business intelligence workflows.
